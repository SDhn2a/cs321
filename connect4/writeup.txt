At 100 rollouts, it wins 15, draws 4, loses 6.
If playing second, it wins 18, draw 0, loses 7.
At 250 rollouts, these improve to 18/3/4, and 21/2/2 when playing second.



When UCB exploration constant is 0.01, its winning ratio (half first half second) is 54 - 16 - 30
When UCB exploration constant is 0.125, its winning ratio (half first half second) is 66 - 16 - 18
When UCB exploration constant is 0.25, its winning ratio (half first half second) is 68 - 14 - 18
When UCB exploration constant is 1, its winning ratio (half first half second) is 70 - 15 - 15
When UCB exploration constant is 2, its winning ratio (half first half second) is 80 - 12 - 8
When UCB exploration constant is 8, its winning ratio (half first half second) is 67 - 18 - 15
When UCB exploration constant is 100, its winning ratio (half first half second) is 59 - 10 - 31

This makes sense; there should be a goldilocks zone, as too much exploration means not enough optimizing, and vice versa



At 8 rollouts vs 64 rollouts, 46 - 26 - 28 (23 - 13 - 14 ratio for comparison)
At 8 rollouts vs 512 rollouts, 31 - 14 - 5
At 64 rollouts vs 512 rollouts, 17 - 26 - 7

As expected, the player with more rollouts is consistently favored, and the more rollouts, the larger the gap.
Also, it seems that two good players are more likely to tie with each other than two poor players.
